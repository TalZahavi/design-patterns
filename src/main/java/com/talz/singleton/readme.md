# Singleton Design Pattern

## The Problem
The application needs one (and only one) instance of an object.

## The Solution
This design pattern ensure a class has only once instance, and provide a global point of access to this instance.

## Main Idea
We show 3 different ways to implement Singleton (Simple, Double check, Early init and Enum). Each one have different
pros and cons.
